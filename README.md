# Collatz Conjecture

## Description
Collatz Conjecture is an unsolved problem in mathematics.
Given a positive integer follow those simple rules:

 * If the integer is even, divide by 2.
 * If the integer is odd, multiply by 3 and then add 1.

According to the conjecture, all numbers will end up in a loop of 4, 2, 1.

My (simple) program creates a visual representation of the graph created by following this set of rules.

For example: 

Given the number 24, the program will create this graph:

## How to run

To run this program simply follow these steps:
 * Clone the repo
 * Run the following command: `pip install networkx matplotlib `
 * Run the program using Python3.
